# Pre-work - *Tipper*

**Tipper** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Harjas Monga**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly *(moved to customize page)*

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
- [x] I added a bill splitting feature
- [x] Improved UI
- [x] Added custom tip options

## Notes

My biggest issue while developing this app was the autolayout. Making it so that it looked correct on all
screen sizes made the autolayout very complicated, and it didn't work in all cases.
